## About This Site

### Prototype Information

Welcome to my website! Please note that this site is currently a prototype. It is hosted on a free cloud service called Render, which helps me manage hosting costs while developing and testing new features.

### Hosting and Performance

Since I use free hosting, you might occasionally experience some performance issues. This isn't due to bugs in the site, but rather because the free server can automatically shut down after periods of inactivity and requires some time to start up again.

Features that might be temporarily unavailable due to this include:

- **Generate Function** on the Challenge page
- **Speak Audio Features**

### Technology Stack

Here's a brief overview of the technologies I used to build this site:

- **Frontend:** Alpine.js
- **Backend API:** Python with Flask
- **Frontend Hosting:** GitHub Pages
- **Backend Hosting:** Render

### Open Source

I believe in open-source software! All of the code for this project is available for free. Feel free to download, inspect, and contribute to the project.
